Ideas for main: The cases are New game, Save game, Load Game, Create Character, Credits and Exit.
New Game and save game can't be selected unless the character is initialised. Load Game should copy the information from a save file into the character strucutre
Create character should erase the existing character and initialize one.

basic story line:

title. 

character creation.

--dialogue tone--
you are a lizard you is trying to find meaning in newfound consiouness and you are absurdist in your methods.

--------
things that we need to do:
we need to add in an inventory class. this will have to be a dynamic double array of strings.
you can change guns here.

we need to create a stack of the time attack which keeps in account all the recent move that you have made.
this will have to be both the array and then an undpated integer that indicates the array size.
