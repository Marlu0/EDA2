CHOICES:

1. I reckon it ain't none of your damn business // Lowers a bit of reputation

2. I ain't. I could use some help tho // Raises a bit of reputation

3. *draw your gun swiftly* // This could make you always shoot first, but lowers reputation a lot and makes enemies stronger at long-term

4. *stay silent* // Neutral reputation, output depends on enemy's mood

*chose C*, starts fight function and adjusts reputation depending on choice
